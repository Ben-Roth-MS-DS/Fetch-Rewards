# Fetch-Rewards: Benjamin Roth Analytic Engineer Take Home Assignment
Thank you for taking the time to go through the work for my take home assignment. Below you'll find brief descriptions of the files and work used to complete the assignment.

1. Review unstructured JSON data and diagram a new structured relational data model
The unstructured JSON data was reviewed using the json_read.py script, and the data model can be found in the data-model.pdf file

2. Generate a query that answers a predetermined business question
I used sqlite in python to generate the sql queries, both of which are specified in the code. To be able to run the query, you have to first run the json_read.py scripts with the json files in the project directory. 
  
3. Generate a query to capture data quality issues against the new structured relational data model
The data_quality.ipynb highlights some of the data quality issues.

4. Write a short email or Slack message to the business stakeholder
The stakeholder_email.docx file contains the email to the business stakeholder.
